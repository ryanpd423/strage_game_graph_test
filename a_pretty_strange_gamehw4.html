<!-- HW4: By Ryan Davis

    The pretty strange game simulation has the user click a button 'run test'
    which runs my game until 50,000 winners have been observed.  This
    implementation will not display a grid for a visual representation of
    each game playing out.

    The rules of this game are similar to those of their implementations.
    The grid is fixed in size at 10x10 (100 spaces).  A red marker that
    begins each game in the bottom-left corner and a blue marker that
    begins each game in the top-right corner.  The game ends when one of
    the markers makes it the other marker's starting point.

    The first 16,666 winners will have had their movements per turn
    limited to a pseudo-random number between 0 and 2.  The second
    16,667 winners will have had their movements per turn limited
    to a pseduo-random number between 2 and 5.  Finally, the third
    16,667 winners will have had their movements per turn limited
    to a psuedo-random number between 5 and 9.

    It was difficult to portray the results lineraly along the X-axis
    as an independent variable might normally be portrayed.  To show
    the results of each game for each of the bands I labeled each
    of the bands 1, 2, or 3 along the X-axis.  X = 1 correlated to the 
    winners that had their moves limited to 0-2 spaces per turn, X = 2
    correlated to the winners that had their moves limited 2-5 spaces per
    turn, and X = 3 correlated to the winners that had their moves
    limited to the 5-9 spaces per turn.

    I implemented this game much like the other iterations in the previous
    homeworks (1,2, and 3).  The difference with this one is that the grid
    is not displayed (this is out of consideration to the processing power
    of the JavaScript runtime).  Also, the game no longer considers
    "bounce backs."  I used the Google Charts API to implement my graph (which
    is a Scatter Chart).  When the 'run test' button is clicked by the user
    a function that simulates each game is run repeatedly until 50,000
    winners have been confirmed.  The first 1/3 of the winners have their
    random move range limited between 0 and 2, the next 1/3 at 2-5, and 
    the final 1/3 at 5-9.  All of this takes place in the gameSimulator()
    function.

    The people in my group that I discussed some of the implementation
    details with are Ian Rodden, Jason Jaeger, and Nathan Rader.

                    <br><br>
                    Each of the X-axis values (1, 2, and 3) will technically have about
                    16,666 data points, but due to the graphical nature of the Google
                    Charts API not all of the data points are able to observed individually
                    by hovering over them with the mouse...There is a TIP below for those
                    curious about the values for all 50,000 winners and the bands that they
                    correlate to :)
                    <br><br>
                 </p>
                 <p><b>TIP: Following the simulation...If you would like to see the arrays of data points for each of the bands follow these steps:</b><br>
                    1) Open Chrome Browser<br>
                    2) Run the test and wait for the results to print to the screen<br>
                    3) Press WindowsBtn + Alt + J<br>
                    4) Click 'Console'<br>
                    5) Find the cmd-entry carot '>'<br>
                    6) Click to the right of the carot (should see text input indicator)<br>
                    7) type: 'total_moves_per_win_when_range_is_0_to_2' and hit ENTER<br>
                    8) type: 'total_moves_per_win_when_range_is_2_to_5' and hit ENTER<br>
                    9) type: 'total_moves_per_win_when_range_is_5_to_9' and hit ENTER<br><br>
                    These will show all 50,000 of the results...the first array corresponds<br>
                    to the first band (0-2 moves per turn), the second array corresponds<br>
                    to the second band (2-5 moves per turn), and the third array corresponds<br>
                    to the third band (5-9 move per turn).
